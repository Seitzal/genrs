# GenRS
[![Travis badge](https://travis-ci.com/Seitzal/OpenTab.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Seitzal/OpenTab)

GenRS (prunounced "generous") will *hopefully* be a lightweight, generic CRUD resource server and permissions system that can 
serve as a plug-and-play backend for simple web applications.

GenRS is written in Scala 3, compiled using the experimental [Dotty Compiler](https://dotty.epfl.ch/), and built using [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).
